    <p><b><h4><i>So, What Is Personal Branding?</i></h4></b></p>

<p style="width: 60%"><b><i>Personal branding is the practice of marketing people and their careers as brands.
It is an ongoing process of developing and maintaining a reputation and impression of an individual, group, or organization.
Whereas some self-help practices focus on self-improvement, personal branding defines success as a form of self-packaging.
Your personal brand is how you promote yourself.
It is the unique combination of skills, experience, and personality that you want your followers to see.
It is the telling of your story, and the impression people gain from your online reputation.</i></b></p><br><br>
